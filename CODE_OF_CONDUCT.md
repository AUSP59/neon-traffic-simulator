# Code of Conduct

> Project: **NeonTrafficSimulator**  
> Maintainers: **@AUSP59** — <alanursapu@gmail.com>

## 1. Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to a welcoming, safe, accessible, inclusive, and respectful community.

## 2. Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community.
- Using inclusive language and accessible formats (e.g., alt text, readable code comments).

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments.
- Trolling, insulting or demeaning remarks, personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Sustained disruption of discussions, issues, reviews, or meetings.

## 3. Responsibilities & Scope
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate, fair corrective action. This Code applies to all community spaces (GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, commits, reviews, releases), and when an individual is officially representing the project in public.

## 4. Reporting & Confidentiality
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to:

- **Primary contact:** **@AUSP59** — <alanursapu@gmail.com>

We will acknowledge receipt **within 72 hours**, provide an initial assessment **within 7 days**, and keep reporters’ identities confidential to the fullest extent legally possible. Reports will not be shared beyond the small review group required to address them. Retaliation against reporters or witnesses is prohibited.

If the report involves a maintainer, they will recuse themselves from handling it.

## 5. Enforcement Guidelines
When addressing violations, maintainers will consider the impact of the behavior and apply consequences consistently, using the following guidelines:

1. **Correction**  
   *Community Impact:* Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
   *Consequence:* Private written warning; guidance on expected behavior.

2. **Warning**  
   *Community Impact:* A single incident or series of actions with moderate impact.  
   *Consequence:* Official warning; continued participation contingent on behavior improvements.

3. **Temporary Suspension**  
   *Community Impact:* Serious violation or repeated inappropriate behavior.  
   *Consequence:* Temporary ban from community spaces and contributions for a set period; conditions for reinstatement stated.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   *Community Impact:* Demonstrating a pattern of inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression; or a single egregious violation.  
   *Consequence:* Permanent removal from community spaces and project participation.

Appeals may be submitted to **@AUSP59** (<alanursapu@gmail.com>) within **14 days** of a decision. Appeals must include new information or context.

## 6. Expectations for Maintainers
- Act promptly on reports; declare conflicts of interest.
- Apply rules consistently and document decisions.
- Prefer education and remediation over punishment where feasible.
- Preserve evidence relevant to reports and decisions.

## 7. Accessibility & Inclusion
- Prefer plain language in issues/PRs.  
- Provide alt text for images; avoid color-only signaling in diagrams.  
- Respect time zones and response latency; no pressure for real-time availability.
