# Governance

## Roles
- **Maintainers:** Own releases and roadmap, review PRs, enforce quality and security.
- **Contributors:** Submit issues/PRs, improve docs and tests.
- **Security Team:** Triage vulnerabilities and coordinate fixes.

## Decision Making
- Technical decisions follow consensus among maintainers. When blocked, a simple majority vote decides.
- Major changes require an ADR (see `docs/design/adrs/`).

## Releases
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
- Release artifacts are signed; SBOM attached to each release.
